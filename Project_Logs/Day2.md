Today we decided to go with a CI/CD Pipeline to manage a Minecraft server with Jenkins and a spot fleet of EC2 Instances.
Our CloudFormation template can be viewed in the project.json file. The link to our Jenkins instance is http://jenkinsmasteralb-1023272808.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com/
You can also find our template in Project logs (YAML.format)
